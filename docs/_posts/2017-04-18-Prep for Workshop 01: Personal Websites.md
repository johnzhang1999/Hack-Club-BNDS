# Preparation Material


In this tutorial we will guide you through the process of setting up your coding and sharing environment. We will be using Github and Cloud9 for the personal website workshop (and probably some other workshops as well). Please be sure to set these up appropriately before coming to our first meeting so that we can have more time working on the real stuff. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to us in the WeChat group. Have fun!


## Part I: Setup

### 1) Signing Up for GitHub

**If you already have a GitHub account, skip to step 3 of Signing Up for GitHub.**

GitHub is a website used by millions of programmers to collaborate on code. We’ll be using it to store and manage our code in Hack Club.

1. Open https://github.com/join (https://github.com/join) in a new tab and ﬁll in: your username (if you can’t decide on one, your ﬁrst and last name are a solid choice) email (you’ll be verifying your email in the next step) password (you’ll need to remember this!) 
2. Verify your email by checking the inbox of the email you used 
3. Open https://gh.hackclub.com (https://gh.hackclub.com) in a new tab and star the project by clicking the button on the top right that looks like this:

Pro tip: if you want a username that’s already taken, you can often get it by contacting GitHub (https://github.com/contact) (this is actually how we got the hackclub username on GitHub). Make sure that the username isn’t actively used by another user before reaching out. Click here (https://help.github.com/articles/name-squatting- policy/) for more details.

### 2) Creating Your First GitHub Repository
GitHub allows us to host our website using a service called GitHub Pages. This means that we can put the ﬁles of our website on GitHub and GitHub will give us a URL that we can share with the world. 

1. Go to https://github.com/new (https://github.com/new) 
2. Under “Repository name” write USERNAME.github.io (replace USERNAME with your actual username). You have to name your repository this in order for GitHub Pages to work correctly (we’ll talk more about GitHub Pages later)

3. Yay! You’ve created your very ﬁrst repository! Now, copy the “HTTPS link” at the top. You will need this link for the next step.
