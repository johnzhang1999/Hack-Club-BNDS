## Overview
In this tutorial we will guide you through the process of setting up your coding and publishing environment. 

We will be using Github ~~and Cloud9~~ (Cloud9 was what hack club officially recommends. However, it seems like you need a credit card to register this, and it works very slowly in our school's network environment, so we decide not to use this for our purpose) for the personal website workshop (and probably some other workshops as well). 

Please be sure to set these up appropriately before coming to our first meeting so that we can have more time working on the real stuff. If you have questions, feel free to reach out to us in the WeChat group. Have fun! :)


## Part I: GitHub Account

### 1) Signing Up for GitHub

**If you already have a GitHub account, skip to step 3 of Signing Up for GitHub.**

GitHub is a website used by millions of programmers to collaborate on code. We’ll be using it to store and manage our code in Hack Club.

1. Open [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) in a new tab and ﬁll in: your username (if you can’t decide on one, your ﬁrst and last name are a solid choice) email (you’ll be verifying your email in the next step) password (you’ll need to remember this!) 

2. Verify your email by checking the inbox of the email you used 
3. Big thanks for [Hack Club San Francisco](http://hackclub.com) of providing BNDS this amazing opportunity to run the club. Let's support them on GitHub! Open [https://gh.hackclub.com](https://gh.hackclub.com) in a new tab and star the project by clicking the button on the top right that looks like this:

### 2) Creating Your First GitHub Repository
GitHub allows us to host our website using a service called GitHub Pages. (And that is what this site is based on!) This means that we can put the ﬁles of our website on GitHub and GitHub will give us a URL that we can share with the world. 

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://gh.hackclub.com)

2. Under “Repository name” write USERNAME.github.io (replace USERNAME with your actual username). You have to name your repository this in order for GitHub Pages to work correctly (we’ll talk more about GitHub Pages later)

3. Yay! You’ve created your very ﬁrst repository! You should see something like the below on.

## Part II GitHub Desktop
As stated in the overview section that we will not be using Cloud9 as our workspace because of registration and network issues, we will instead be using our own computers as our workspaces. (Yay!) In this way, we can store all the source files (codes we will working on) in our own computers. 

For beginners, let us use GitHub Desktop (which is a graphic user interface of git). For those who are very familiar with git, feel free to use git commands.
### 1) Downloading and Setting the GitHub Desktop

1. Open the link: https://desktop.github.com/ and click the download button. The website should provide the correct version for you, but if not, make sure that you are downloading the correct version (i.e. if you are macOS users, do not download the Windows version.)

2. Properly install the thing you have downloaded. If you need help, please reach out to us.
3. Login your GitHub account. 

### 2) Cloning a Repository

1. Click on "+", "Clone", select the repository you just created in Part I, which has the name of <YOUR USERNAME>.github.io
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnzhang1999/Hack-Club-BNDS/master/docs/_posts/media/14925122494367/14925196569487.jpg)
Note: By cloning a repository, you have created a mirror (or downloaded) that repository to your local environment (in this case, your computer), so that later you can edit your code on your computer and commit (sync the changes) to your repository.

2. Click "Clone <REPOSITORY NAME>" at the bottom right.
3. Choose a local path that you would like to store your repo.
4. Wait a few seconds and you are done! You should see something like this when GitHub is cloning.

## Final Words

**Congratulations! You have made a big step! **

You are done with all the setup you need for the semester and maybe for the rest of your computer science life. GitHub will be a good friend as we are going on our way and working on our projects. 

There are lots of professional programmers and scientists who are active on GitHub. Free free to explore the GitHub [here](https://github.com/explore).
